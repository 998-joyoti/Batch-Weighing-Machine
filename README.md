# Batch-Weighing-Machine
### Problem Statement
A microprocessor system is to be designed as a batch weighing machine. The system is interfaced to three load cells by means of a 10‐ bit A/D converter.
The conditioned output of the load cells is given by the equation: Vout = K x weight (Kgs.), where K is dependent on the property of the sensor.
The system monitors the output of the load cells and finds out the total weight by taking the average of the three values that are sensed by each load cell. This value is displayed on a seven‐segment display. When this value exceeds 50 kgs, an output port, which is connected to a relay, is switched on to sound an alarm. Design the necessary hardware and software for implementing the above‐mentioned task.
### Assumptions
1) All load cells are different and hence will give different values of weight.
2) Weight is equivalent to the input voltage of load cell
3) Vout of the load cell is the voltage given by amplifier
4) The A/D converter is 8‐bit.
### Software Used
